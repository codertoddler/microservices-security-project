*** Docker Attack Surfaces ***

1. Docker Client compromise

Attacker can spoof traffic from client to host and thereby gaining unauthorized access - SPOOFING

2. Dockerfile misconfiguration

Attacker can modify Dockerfile to introduce unintended code/images which can lead to malicious code running in the container and overall cluster compromise - TAMPERING

3. Use of --privilege flag in the host

Any elevation of privilege in the host can lead to unintended access across containers leading to isolation tampering - ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGE

4. Misconfiguration of host

If the configuration of the host is misconfigured, it might disclose sensitive information leading to unintended defaults leading to a potential widended security incident - INFORMATION DISCLOSURE

5. Docker Image Security

Once an Attacker gains unauthorized access, it can lead to malicious images being committed without authorization and image security is comporomised - REPUDIATION


*** Kubernetes System Attack Surfaces***

Attack Surfaces

1. Kube API Server compromise

Attacker can spoof traffic to API Server and thereby gaining unauthorized access - SPOOFING

2. etcd misconfiguration

Attacker can modify etcd configuration to modify pod specs leading to pod eviction/other unintended consequences - TAMPERING

3. etcd sensitive information comprimise

Once an attacker gains access to etcd key-value store, it can lead to sentive information discosure  - INFORMATION DISCLOSURE

4. Kube API Server overwhelming

Attacker can overwhelm the API Server with excessive number of requests thereby leading to wrong scehduling of pods  - DENIAL OF SERVICE

5. Kube API Server authorization abuse

Once an Attacker gains unauthorized access to API server, it can lead to abuse of privilege flag - ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGE

** Hardening Docker Environment **

[FAIL] 5.10 Ensure that the memory usage for container is limited (Automated)
[FAIL] 5.11 Ensure that CPU priority is set appropriately on container (Automated)
[FAIL] 5.14 Ensure that the 'on-failure' container restart policy is set to '5' (Automated)
