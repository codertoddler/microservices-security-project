1. How will you test the changes?

a. The changes will be tested in a "test cluster" different from "production cluster". Also
app manifests will be templatized and separate helm value charts will be created for test and production.
b. The audit logs will be captured and monitored to ensure all risks are accounted.
c. Test if containers and pods are run with least privilege.
d. Scan containers and pods for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
e. Test if strong authentication and authorization is used to limit user and administrator access as well as to limit the attack surface.

2. How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?

a. The changes are tested in non production cluser. 
b. The falco metrics will be continously monitored with grafana.
c. Health metrics shall be monitored carefully to ensure the tests are running within specified parameters.
d. The changes can be rolled back as the cluster.yml is git versioned in case of any uncontrolled situation.
e. Alerts can be setup in grafana to communicate any events outside the test parameters so that the situation can be addressed without further escalation.
